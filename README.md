My personal portfolio website made using HTML, CSS and JavaScript without any additional framworks or libraries. 

<a href="https://fontawesome.com/">Font Awesome</a> toolkit was used for the logos.
<a href="https://animate.style/">Animate-CSS</a> library was used for some animations.

The website is currently hosted at : https://pritomdutta89.github.io/Portfolio.github.io/
